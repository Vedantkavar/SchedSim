SchedSim 🕒
A CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator (FCFS, SJF, RR, Priority)

SchedSim is a simple, interactive web-based simulator that visually demonstrates how different CPU scheduling algorithms work. Ideal for students, educators, and anyone interested in Operating System concepts.

🔧 Features
📊 Visual Simulation of:

FCFS (First-Come First-Served)

SJF (Shortest Job First) – Non-preemptive

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin Scheduling

📈 Gantt Chart Visualization

🔁 Dynamic Process Input (arrival time, burst time, priority, quantum)

🧠 Calculates:

Completion Time

Turnaround Time

Waiting Time

Average Waiting & Turnaround Time

🧼 Clear and Reset Functions
